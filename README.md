# Comprehensive Architectural Security Assessment (IBM Cloud)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **3-phase, intelligence-driven security assessment** of a multi-tier web application hosted on **IBM Cloud**. As a Senior Security Architect, I conducted a deep-dive analysis focusing on how threats propagate through complex cloud infrastructures, integrating business logic with technical defense strategies.

## Key Phases & Achievements

### Phase 1: Advanced Threat Modeling
* **Multi-Layered DFDs:** Developed three interconnected Data Flow Diagrams (**Business Logic, Technical Architecture, and Trust Boundaries**) to map data movement and identify "Crown Jewel" assets.
* **STRIDE Attack Chains:** Modeled end-to-end attack scenarios (e.g., from initial spoofing to privilege escalation and data exfiltration) rather than isolated vulnerabilities.
* **Dynamic DREAD Scoring:** Created a **Contextual Risk Register** that adjusts risk scores based on the current threat landscape, regulatory requirements (GDPR/PCI DSS), and business impact.

### 🔍 Phase 2: Intelligence-Driven Reconnaissance (OSINT)
* **Attack Surface Mapping:** Conducted an OSINT campaign to map digital footprints, including **shadow IT**, partner integrations, and cloud configurations.
* **Evolution Timeline:** Analyzed how the organization’s attack surface evolved over a **2-year period** to identify emerging exposure patterns.

### Phase 3: Risk Integration & Executive Strategy
* **Risk Intersection Analysis:** Identified **"choke points"** where multiple technical vulnerabilities converge to create maximum business impact.
* **Gap Analysis:** Evaluated the current **IBM Cloud posture** against industry best practices and compliance frameworks.
* **Executive Communication:** Produced a 2-page **Executive Risk Brief** translating technical findings into business-centric recommendations for C-suite decision-making.
